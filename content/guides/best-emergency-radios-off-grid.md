## What to look for

### 1) Power options that match reality
- Primary: replaceable AA/AAA or a reliable rechargeable pack
- Backup: hand‑crank and/or solar
- Bonus: USB power bank output (useful, but don’t over‑trust it)

### 2) Alert behavior
Look for clear alert mode, volume control, and settings you can understand quickly.

### 3) Usability in the dark
Prefer clear buttons, readable displays, and straightforward tuning.

### 4) Audio clarity
A radio that works but is impossible to hear is a failure.

### 5) Storage & durability
If it lives in a car or go‑bag, plan for temperature swings and battery leakage prevention.

## Minimal off‑grid setup
- 1 primary emergency radio (home)
- spare batteries stored properly
- written frequency notes
- 1 compact radio for a go‑bag (optional)

## Common mistakes
1) Buying features you never use
2) No battery plan
3) Never testing it

## FAQ

### Do I need a hand‑crank radio?
It’s a great backup. Most people still rely on batteries as primary.

### What’s the difference vs normal AM/FM?
Emergency radios prioritize multiple power options, alerts and durability.

### Can it replace a satellite communicator?
No. Radios receive information; satellite messengers can send out.

### One radio per person?
Usually no. One solid home unit + one compact go‑bag unit is a practical start.
